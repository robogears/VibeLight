# iOS streaming — status

**✅ SHIPPED & DEVICE-VERIFIED (2026-07-06):** in-process streaming on iPad works
end-to-end — video (native 2752×2064@120 over a Tailscale DERP relay), game
audio (Opus → RemoteIO), and controller input (full pad forwarding + the
Start+Select+LB+RB leave-stream chord — held ~2s with a progress ring, like the
launcher's hold-to-quit). Perf HUD via Settings ▸ Advanced ▸ Performance
Stats. User settings pass through uncapped; a too-hot profile over a relay
shows up as FEC starvation (`X received < Y needed`) — lower the bitrate.

## Architecture (as landed)

- `VibeLight/Streaming/MoonlightSession.mm` — ObjC++ bridge around
  moonlight-common-c: `LiStartConnection` on a serial lifecycle queue (the
  library is single-connection; overlap = double-free), H.264 Annex-B→AVCC
  decode into `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`, Opus multistream → RemoteIO
  AudioUnit through a lock-free SPSC ring, controller snapshots via
  `LiSendMultiControllerEvent`.
- `VibeLight/App/iOS/InProcessStreamEngine.swift` — @MainActor engine behind
  the shared `StreamEngine` seam: /launch → session lifecycle → phase
  transitions, controller passthrough install/remove, perf-stats task,
  AVAudioSession playback category.
- `VibeLight/Input/ControllerManager.swift` — `streamForwarder` flips all pads
  between launcher navigation and raw stream passthrough.

## Hard-won invariants (do not regress)

1. **PICDATA buffer-list entries are RTP fragments, not NALUs.** Reassemble the
   full Annex-B stream, then convert by scanning for real start codes. Treating
   entries as NALUs corrupts every multi-packet frame → silent black screen.
2. **DrSubmit/ClLogMessage run on pool-less C threads** — every ObjC allocation
   there must sit inside `@autoreleasepool` or it leaks to jetsam (~minutes at
   high res).
3. **LiStartConnection/LiStopConnection must never overlap** — serialize through
   `LifecycleQueue`; the engine stops the old session before launching anew.
4. **`disconnect()` must transition phase itself** — after releasing
   session/proxy the termination callback can't reach us; without a local
   transition the UI freezes on `.streaming` over a dead stream.
5. **encryptionFlags = ENCFLG_NONE** with this host; requesting AV encryption
   broke audio decrypt + control (mbedcrypto CBC path is the suspect — revisit
   if a host *requires* encryption).
6. Audio callbacks are allocation-free C with a lock-free ring; drop NEW
   packets when the backlog exceeds ~60 ms (a full-only drop policy ratchets
   latency up after every jitter burst and never drains).
7. **Return DR_NEED_IDR from every submit failure path** (Limelight.h contract).
   DR_OK on an unprocessed IDR marks it consumed in the depacketizer and nothing
   ever re-requests a keyframe — black/corrupt until manual disconnect.
8. `stop()`'s teardown block must capture self STRONGLY (engine drops its ref
   immediately after; weak capture skips LiStopConnection). Remote termination
   also needs an explicit stop() — the callback alone leaves threads running.
9. Host busy (`currentgame != 0`) → `/resume`, never `/launch` (Sunshine rejects
   it). 22-finding parity audit vs moonlight-ios landed 2026-07-06 (91d3ca1).
10. **The ONE shared `displayLayer` re-parents between the iPad `DisplayLayerView`
    and the TV `DisplayHostView`; guard re-attach on TREE MEMBERSHIP
    (`display.superlayer !== layer`), never object identity.** `dismiss()` detaches
    the layer (`removeFromSuperlayer`) but leaves the host's `attached` ref dangling,
    so an identity guard (`attached === display`) skips `addSublayer` on the next
    launch → the TV goes BLACK on every stream RE-launch (fixed 2026-07-07). The
    layer is a lifetime `let`, so its `weak attached` cache never nils on its own.

## Remaining roadmap (in rough priority)

- HEVC/HDR (`supportedVideoFormats |= H265/H265_MAIN10`, HEVC path exists in
  `rebuildFormatDescription`, untested)
- Rumble (ConnListenerRumble → GCController.haptics)
- Frame pacing / A-V sync polish; stats HUD could add host fps + loss %

Done since: **external display / TV output** (`App/iOS/ExternalDisplay.swift` —
device-verified). When a TV/monitor is attached, the stream renders on it at the
display's NATIVE resolution while the iPad keeps controls + acts as a trackpad.
The idle LAUNCHER UI on the TV is super-sampled to ≥2× (`launcherRenderScale` +
`ExternalLauncherHost`): old 1080p TVs report `displayScale` 1.0, so a fixed-canvas
`scaleEffect` would rasterize at 1× and UPSCALE to the panel → blurry text. Forcing
≥2× (trait override + `\.displayScale` env + layer `contentsScale`, all at the same
target) rasterizes at 2× and DOWNSAMPLES → crisp. Stream video is unaffected (native
pixel res, separate root VC). KEY LESSON: needs a real `UIWindowScene` — the legacy `UIWindow.screen=` API no
longer renders on external screens, and iOS only creates the external scene when
`UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes: true` is in the Info.plist (with
`UIRequiresFullScreen` still true so no Split View). Setting: Settings ▸ Video ▸
Use TV / Monitor (default on, auto-engages). Something stock moonlight-ios can't
do (their issue #634, open since 2024).

Also done: touch-as-input (native LiSendTouchEvent + absolute-mouse fallback
with double-tap deadzone; Settings ▸ Input ▸ Touch Control), keep-awake during
stream (`refreshKeepAwake` — Auto-Lock killed an 8-minute session; gamepad
input never resets the idle timer), iOS "Quit Game on App Exit"
(scenePhase .background → teardown + /cancel in a UIKit background task; also
prevents host-side stale-session poisoning on relaunch), and PS/Home-button
delivery in-stream (disable system gestures on the pad while streaming).

## QoL roadmap (from deep-research, ranked by demand × solo-app feasibility)

1. Clipboard sync (client↔host text) — most-reacted open moonlight-qt issue;
   Apollo/Vibepollo has the host side, reverse the wire format from Artemis.
2. Client-driven virtual display (host makes a display matching the client) —
   Apollo's headline differentiator; VibeLight already sends res/fps in /launch.
3. "Match current display" auto stream-mode (macOS side; iOS already native).
4. iOS keyboard — virtual + hardware passthrough (killer combo with WoL: the
   Windows login prompt after wake).
5. ✅ iPad → external display at native res — DONE (above).
6. In-stream touch-mode switcher (direct / trackpad / off, mid-session).
7. Surface Apollo per-client tier (permissions, input-only, connect/disconnect
   commands like auto-pause).
8. Custom on-screen buttons (keyboard commands as tappable buttons).
- Microphone passthrough: high demand but blocked on unmerged host PRs — watch.
